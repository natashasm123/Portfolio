        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p><h3>Hello, I'm Natasha Mali from Belagavi. I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Jain College of Engineering and Research, Belagavi.</h3></p>
    
        <p><h3>My educational journey began at KLE's Independent PU College in Chikodi, where I completed my Pre-University Course (PUC). Prior to that, I received my schooling at GSE Society's English Medium School, Chikodi. These formative years have shaped my passion for learning and my commitment to academic excellence.</h3></p>
    
        <p><h3>Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a strong interest in computer science and technology. I'm enthusiastic about exploring new technologies and solving real-world problems through programming and software development.</h3></p>
    
        <p><h3>When I'm not immersed in the world of coding, I enjoy Dancing, Drawing and Travelling. I believe in the power of continuous learning, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge in the ever-evolving field of technology.</h3></p>
    
        <p><h3>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. If you'd like to get in touch or learn more about my work. I'm excited to connect and explore new opportunities!</h3></p>
